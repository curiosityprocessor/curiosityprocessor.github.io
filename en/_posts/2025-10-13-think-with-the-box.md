## Think out of the box
The phrase think-out-of-the-box suggests a creative, innovative approach that surpasses existing boundaries.  
It shows a connotation of breaking the barrier, something that takes immense effort and ingenuity.  
But let's dial back and review how the 'thinking' and 'box' interact.  

## The 'think'
If I were to draw the shape of 'thinking' on a notepad, it would be like a cloud.  
Some areas would be large, others will be small, with connecting lines swirling in and out.  
Throughout life, as you gain interest and expertise, relevant areas expand while irrelevant ones shrink.  
With insight, some areas could merge and/or rapidly grow.  
Our thinking is not neat or fixed - it's amorphous, changing and alive.  

## The 'box'
The 'box' refers to a set of principles, rules, or standards that applies to a large group of people.  
It could be an institution like a school, or ideas like social norms, political views or standards like professionalism.  
By nature, it is fixed and rigid. It does not cater to individual differences but rather serves to set common grounds.  
Hence, the term 'box', notating a fixed boundary indicating how an individual should act accordingly.  

## How the 'think' and 'box' overlap
Let's draw the 'think' and the 'box' on the same notepad.  
For many, overlapping the 'think' and 'box' would reveal areas where the 'think' outreaches the 'box'  
and others where the box encapsulates the think with plenty of space to spare.  
The area where the think surpasses the box is where 'genius' shows. Someone that is extraordinary, hard to grasp by common sense.  
But maybe they are not so alien, in that simply their interests and expertise in said area surpass the expected common or base standard.  

On the other hand, areas where the think underperforms the box is where institution and norms nudges the individual to arise to social standard.  
The box simply defines commonly accepted and/or expected standard - a marker for individuals to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.  

## Rethinking the think-out-of-the-box
Heading back to the phrase 'think-out-of-the-box', it seems less of an active struggle to break the barrier,  
and more of a realisation of finding what your existing strengths are.  
It doesn't mean blindly shooting holes in the box for an opening, not a total disregard of the rules and regulations confining you,  
but suggests searching for your strengths that surpass the common standard, the interests and expertise you gained over the years.  
To think **with** the box is a journey of deep, self reflection to find your strengths and weaknesses.  
The key is to not let the gaps discourage you, nor to lose areas where you overflow.  
Your 'edges' that flow out of the box are what makes you special. A stale 'edge' would eventually shrink back inside the box.  

## Applying think-with-the-box
This is a tech blog after all, so let's apply this to software engineering.  
One example could be the relationship between business requirements and frameworks to implement them.  
Business requirements are more like the 'think' - flexible, ambiguous, changing.
Frameworks provide a set of tools and rules that enforce a standard behaviour - helpful for the average developer.  
As you implement the business requirement, you will find areas where the framework outperforms business requirements.  
Maybe it enhances the security needs with built-in auths, encryption, etc.  
Maybe it enriches the user experience with native scrolling, paging, lazy-loading.  
However you also find areas where the business requirements exist outside of the scope of the framework.  
After all, if every business requirement could be implemented by frameworks alone, there would be no need for individual developers.  
This is where devs are pushed to 'think-out-of-the-box' to tackle the problem.  
You would borrow from your past experiences to piece together step-by-step solutions or find work-around or even create a whole new solution.  

To _think with the box_ is to utilize both the stability of the box and the creativity of the think, in harmony.
